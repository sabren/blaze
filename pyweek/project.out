
PyWeek Project Outline for Team Trailblazer


*## complete (more or less?) ######################

load pyODE room from svg 
display pngs on screen
calorie counting


*## in progress ###################################

mcferill : main game loop (title->[play,quit])
sabren: observe pyODE and update sprite position
hippo: font rendering, high score screen
StupidMop: break layers into separate files in inkscape
PyTM30: collision detection and physics
JtP: build a level
illume: sound/music system


*## most needed ###################################

** workflow 
*** title screen
*** level picker
*** game mode
**** dialogs
***** pause
***** confirm quit
*** enter your name
either up front or on high score
up front is probably better so we
can track all score data per user 
per level...
*** some kind of ending?
*** high score list
*** credits

** on screen display
show the score
show calorie bar
show time bar

** event system
observe pyODE, fire events
take keyboard events from pygame

** sprite system
get sprite module working for the pygame display
http://kai.vm.bytemark.co.uk/~piman/writing/sprite-tutorial.shtml
http://www.pygame.org/docs/tut/SpriteIntro.html


** metabolism
update the display
tie movement to health model
 - model provides exert(level) method.  The harder the action, the higher the level.
tie mass to health model
 - need an algorithm to derive mass from fat. Hrm.
tune values for playability

** player movement
left and right
jumping/"flying"
update player position in pyODE for the keyboard


** time constraint
end level when time runs out
some kind of message or animation?
countdown when end is near?

** interaction (collisions)
*** automatic (just touch)
food updates the calorie bank
  -- Done.  subclass health.Food and pass it to health.HealthModel.eat()
handle scoring:eggs give you points

*** objects (press up to activate)
handle doors (move player to another part of screen)
handle ladders (allow player to climb)

*** platforms
normal : pyODE should handle for us
basic : 

** scoring system
high score list
increase score as eggs are found

** save progress
probably just do this automatically 
(possibly for each user?)
  -- how about beating levels unlocks new levels, a la N?
  -- either select level from a menu, or old-skool it with a code


*## blue sky ######################################

record events for playback of best times, etc...



*## unfiled #######################################



different types of food (?)
   <eykd> Yes, just subclass health.Food(sugar, fat)


* pygame view
  - background comes from a PNG file
  - action layer for our moving sprites
  - foreground comes from a PNG file


"""
brain dump
----------

okay. this file right here is all about physics.
everything in here should be all about physics.
so we don't care about screen coordinates here.
if pyODE uses Boxes where coordiantes are the
center, then that's what we use.
# DONE


Rect->Block belongs in the loader module because
we're taking svg and making blocks out of it.


Block->Rect is a problem we haven't gotten to yet.
We never have to map a block back to a screen
rectangle unless that block moves. We'll need
that for the hero, but it's a display method
and we can cross that bridge when we come to it.
"""


* simple physics
"""Adam: I'm going to start the physics engine using pyODE 
if nobody has any objections. I'm also going to have a 
module that can import different physics for each level
from a pickle"""
  - gravity
  - jumping or flying
  - fine grained coordinates
  - collision detection

* world objects
  - doors
  - ladders
  - springs? (like pinball?)
  - seesaws?
  - boulders?

* sloped terrain
  - N tutorials

* scrolling / big rooms
  - I like big rooms. Whatever floats your boat :\

* animation
  - walking, climbing, etc
can chickens actually climb? they can fly :o ya don't say oh, i do >_>
  - obligatory t-rex action

* scoring system
  - high score list?
  - t-rex tells you your score.. without verbs!

* enemies
  - racing?
  - joust for air battle
  - sumo for fat battle ? Cool chicken sumo!!
  - many references to t-rex

* marketing
  - game name - ? Willy Wonkas chicken factory -_-
  - game logo - a large chicken bar :)

* loading/saving game
  - pickle?
