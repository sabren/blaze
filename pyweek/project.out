
PyWeek Project Outline for Team Trailblazer


* model of the world [in progress]
  - the model of the world is based on pyODE

* level Loader

  - isolate "blocks" layer before it gets
    to our parser

  - turn the rect tags into Rects

  - turn Rects into Blocks



* pygame view
  - background comes from a PNG file
  - action layer for our moving sprites
  - foreground comes from a PNG file







"""
brain dump
----------

okay. this file right here is all about physics.
everything in here should be all about physics.
so we don't care about screen coordinates here.
if pyODE uses Boxes where coordiantes are the
center, then that's what we use.
# DONE


Rect->Block belongs in the loader module because
we're taking svg and making blocks out of it.


Block->Rect is a problem we haven't gotten to yet.
We never have to map a block back to a screen
rectangle unless that block moves. We'll need
that for the hero, but it's a display method
and we can cross that bridge when we come to it.
"""


* move around the level
  - populate world with levels from pgu
  - world is created in inkscape, exported to PNG for viewing, SVG file used for pyODE / collision detection / object placement
  - player should be able to move around freely
  - coarse-grained coordinates / collisions

* calorie system
  - food 
  - calories affect counters
  - change body type

* simple physics
"""Adam: I'm going to start the physics engine using pyODE 
if nobody has any objections. I'm also going to have a 
module that can import different physics for each level
from a pickle"""
  - gravity
  - jumping or flying
  - fine grained coordinates
  - collision detection

* world objects
  - doors
  - ladders
  - springs? (like pinball?)
  - seesaws?
  - boulders?

* sloped terrain
  - N tutorials

* scrolling / big rooms
  - I like big rooms. Whatever floats your boat :\
  - ...

* sound effects and music
  - OGGs or MIDI? Ogg 
  - i don't think there is a midi system for pygame anyway (??)

* animation
  - walking, climbing, etc
can chickens actually climb? they can fly :o ya don't say oh, i do >_>
  - obligatory t-rex action

* scoring system
  - high score list?
  - t-rex tells you your score.. without verbs!

* enemies
  - racing?
  - joust for air battle
  - sumo for fat battle ? Cool chicken sumo!!
  - many references to t-rex

* marketing
  - game name - ? Willy Wonkas chicken factory -_-
  - game logo - a large chicken bar

* loading/saving game
  - pickle?
