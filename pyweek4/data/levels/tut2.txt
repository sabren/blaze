Level 2:

Yipe! security cameras! These weren't 
here when I last visited! He must have
installed them after he stole it from me.


Security Cameras:

Being seen by a camera will trigger an
alarm and alert security on this floor
to your presence. To get past slip
underneath it while it's turned away
and wait until it turns back the other
way, allowing you to continue. When
you are directly underneath a camera
it will not see you.
