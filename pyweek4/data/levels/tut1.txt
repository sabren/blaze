It is mine, MINE!!! but he took it, in his
foolishness he took that which is not his,
and his own folly shall be his undoing. If
he takes of mine, I shall reclaim it to his
hurt.

Level 1:

First things first, you can move side to
side with the arrow keys, and up and down
the ladders with the up and down arrows.

Now try holding the left shift while
walking, you will sprint at about 3x your
normal speed, this is extremely important
when avoiding security so keep it in mind.

Once you're ready, find the exit in the
top-right corner of the room to move on.
