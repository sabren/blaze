Aha! A guard! No doubt there are more 
of them around here somewhere.

Security Guards:

To engage a guard you have two options:
punching or kicking, either of which will
incapacitate them for the time being.
The difference is that if you kick an
enemy from behind he will fly a few
feet and knock out any guards he hits.
Do NOT do this if he is running at you
however as they are quite heavy and will
have the same effect on you as on their
comrades.
