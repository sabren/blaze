	1. Description
	
		Directicus is latin for "simple", pointing to its purpose - to be a simple,

	flexable, and easy to use code library. It builds on pygame (http://pygame.org) and 

	adds a few simple yet useful components like pixel-perfect collision detection, 

	menus, a state engine, and things like that. Each code file when run by itself will 

	run a visible (and audible in the case of sfx.py) demo of the functionality it 

	contains while still using the other files.



	2. How to Use

		You can use docutils help() function in the interpreter to view the 

	embedded docstrings or you can look for Directicus on our website at 

	http://blazeofglory.org for more recent information.
