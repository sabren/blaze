Henry Miller was a confederate army 
intelligence officer who infiltrated 
the northern navy in 1861 while that 
military was still recruiting to fill 
the ranks of their forces.

    In 1865 he finally got assigned 
to the ironclad project and a month
afterward he aquired a copy of the 
original plans for the USS Monitor.
Unfortunately he was discovered the 
next day and had to flee for his life.
He stowed away on an english ship 
and making himself useful escaped
being thrown overboard like any 
other unwanted passenger. 

    Once in europe
he had intendeed to take another ship 
back to the confederacy but before 
he had raised the passage money the 
news arrived that Lee had surrendered.
He debated for a long time whether to 
return or not when he was approached
by agents from the spanish monarch 
Ferdinand VI. They had heard of his 
mission through some spy or other 
and had tracked him down. They had
heard of the ironclad technology 
and wanted to produce it for themselves
He agreed to build a prototype based on 
the plans he had stolen for a large sum 
of money.

    About a month into the work he 
overheard some of the guards talking
and learned that they planned to kill 
him as soon as the ironclad was 
operational. 
    
    Seeing no escape from 
the innumerable guards he threw
himself into the work with a vengeance 
and upon completion he went aboard,
bolted the doors, and with a prayer 
to God for aid set out to break out of the
channel into the Mediterranean sea...
