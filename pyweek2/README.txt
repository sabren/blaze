---Installing and Running---

Clad in Iron requires

python 2.4 or greater
pygame 1.7 or greater
eventnet (included with distribution)

If you downloaded the source run main.py in the CII dir, 
or if you have the windows executable run 
Clad in Iron.exe.

If you find any bugs, see any improvements that could 
be made, or want to give us other feedback send a line to
webmaster@blazeofglory.org .



---Playing the Game---

Clad in Iron is a top-down shooter with a steam-powered
ironclad warship as the hero. The default controls are

W		Move forward
S		Move backward
D		Rudder right
A		Rudder left
Mouse		Aim cannons
MouseButton1	Fire left cannon
MouseButton2	Fire right cannon
Escape		In-game menu/pause

These controls can be modified via the options section
in the main menu. Enemies for now are shore-based 
artillery. These will not move but their weapons will
eventually destroy your ship if you give them time.

---Extra Features---

CII has its own tile-based level editor and the way the
code is structured allows for easy addition of tiles and
levels even with the executable (although ones options
are much more numerous in the source distribution).


---Future Possibilities---

We plan on improving usability on the editor and game,
adding multiplayer and network play, and a host of other
things so keep watching on our website at
